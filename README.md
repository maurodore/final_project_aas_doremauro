# Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the **Autonomous and Adaptive Systems** course project. This study investigates the application of **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to a selection of tasks from the **Procgen Benchmark**.  
The **Procgen Benchmark**, developed by OpenAI, consists of 16 procedurally generated game-like environments designed to test sample efficiency and generalization in reinforcement learning.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to replicate and explore the PPO approach, closely following the methodology outlined by OpenAI. The implementation details are discussed, including the explanation for certain deviations from the original Procgen publication.  
The experiments demonstrate that the agent learns and generalizes effectively, producing results consistent with those reported in the original studies.

# Training Results

The training results are showcased in the videos below. These videos highlight the performance of the trained agents in two specific Procgen environments: **Coinrun** and **Caveflyer**.
